Recently, we have started working with the (Macromolecular Crystallography group)[https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx.html], which is based at the [Diamond synchrotron](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) in Didcot, UK. We have a common interest in enabling reproducible, user-friendly data analysis in cheminformatics and computational chemistry. As part of their [XChem project](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html), they are developing computational workflows to assist in designing follow-up compounds from fragment screening hits. Diamond is working with [Informatics Matters](https://www.informaticsmatters.com/) to develop (Squonk)[https://squonk.it], a computational notebook with similar aims to the [ChemicalToolbox](http://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu) we are working on. We were interested in investigating how Squonk and Galaxy could be integrated.

Recently, [Tim Dudgeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timdudgeon/) from Informatics Matters and [Rachael Skyner](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening/XChem-team/Skyner.html) from Diamond visited Freiburg to find out more about Galaxy. We spent two days discussing and together developed a new Galaxy tool which can be used as part of a protein-ligand docking workflow. The aim is to get a Galaxy instance running at Diamond in the near future, and eventually, we hope to create a common base of tools for compuational chemistry that can be utilized by both of our platforms.
