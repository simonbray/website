Recently, we have started working with the (Macromolecular Crystallography group)[https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx.html], which is based at the [Diamond synchrotron](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) in Didcot, UK. We have a common interest in enabling reproducible, user-friendly data analysis in cheminformatics and computational chemistry. They are developing (Squonk)[https://squonk.it], a computational notebook with similar aims to the [ChemicalToolbox](http://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu) we are working on.

Last week, [Tim Dudgeon](https://www.informaticsmatters.com) and [Rachael Skyner](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening/XChem-team/Skyner.html) visited Freiburg to find out more about Galaxy. We spent two days discussing and together developed a new Galaxy tool which can be used as part of a protein-ligand docking workflow. Eventually, we hope to create a common base of tools for computational chemistry that can be utilized by both of our platforms.
