Recently, we have started working with the (Macromolecular Crystallography group)[https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx.html], which is based at the Diamond synchrotron in Didcot, UK. We have a common interest in enabling reproducible, user-friendly data analysis in cheminformatics and computational chemistry. They are developing (Squonk)[https://squonk.it/], a computational notebook with similar aims to the ChemicalToolbox we are working on.

Last month, Tim Dudgeon and Rachael Skyner visited Freiburg to find out more about Galaxy. We spent two days discussing and together developed a new Galaxy tool which can be used as part of a protein-ligand docking workflow. Eventually, we hope to create a common base of tools for compuational chemistry that can be utilized by both of our platforms.
